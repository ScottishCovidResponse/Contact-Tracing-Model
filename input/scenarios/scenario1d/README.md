Alerting is based on reporting by symptomatic individuals. 
Contacts of reportee from last **X** days alerted and asked to isolate for **Y** days from the time of **contact**.
Vary **X** and **Y** in range 0 to 14 and investigate trade-off between R and number of person days in isolation.
Also isolate secondary contacts from time of contact.

In this example X is fixed to 11 and Y is fixed to 12.
