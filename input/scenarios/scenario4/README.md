Alerting is based on a **positive test** on symptomatic individuals.
Choose **X** and **Y** from scenario 1c.
Isolate all contacts until they are tested. Release negative contacts and isolate positive contacts for **Y** days from time of alert.
Include delay between reporting symptoms and test result. How much does delay reduce impact of contact tracing.

In this example X is fixed to 11 and Y is fixed to 12.
